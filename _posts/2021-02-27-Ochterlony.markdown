'At first the company, even with its new responsiblities, remained a swashbuckling, showy, amoral kind of service. It bred eccentrics and flamboyants, like old Sir David Ochterlony, for example, British resident at the the court of the king of Delhi, who used to travel about the country in a carriage and four, huddled in furs, shawls, and wraps of gold brocade, and attended by platoons of spearmen, troops of horsemen and, so legend said, thirteen wives each on her own elephant. There were few Englishwomen in India then, the sea passage being so long and dangerous, and the climate so dreadful, so that Englishmen were closer to Indian life than their successors were to be - often with Indian mistresses, generally with Indian friends, and cherishing little sense of racial or religious superiority...Often they were men of aestehtic sensibilities too, and responded sensually to all the gaudy seductions of the land.'

These men would be wonderful to write about - to learn more about, and maybe to fictionalise - the 18th century against the 19th.
