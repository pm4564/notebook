I'd like to leave some things behind. Maybe something extra special like progress in science or some tool or something - that might be nice. But as much as anything like that I'd like to leave a few simpler but useful things. I think I should be writing a cookery book, which I should be doing in the zettelkasten - that seems very achievable to me. And I like the idea of a few more instruction books - keeping a record of how I learn and teach things in life and making little booklets or pamphlets and all that - it's sort of why I like the idea of a zettelkasten, because I can just keep a record of all the things I learn and have something to give to someone - and whatever wisdom or humour I stumble across can just be scattered around in there. There would be a lot of beauty in something like that. 

Similarly I think the move to songwriting should be recorded...as I learn about theory and keys and songwriting basics and all that, keep a record so that the skill can be passed on. The vision I have is of a family that has a lot of it's implicit knowledge recorded...something else, rather than just my own experiences, is to start recording Mum and Dad's too, as well as the grandparents - though that's a taller order. 

A project I would love to complete in time for Grandpa's next birthday is the transcription of Bernard's war diary, perhaps with a map of where he went and what happened on those sections of the front - so that in the near future we could do a guided battlefield tour.
