Houellebecq writes about mercy-killing: https://unherd.com/2021/04/how-france-lost-her-dignity/

What do I think about mercy-killing? I think there is honour in choosing to end your life the way you want. 

I think there is less honour and a medicalised and regulated system of mercy-killing - hospitals and doctors and cables and machines and plastic and strange smells are not how I want to spend my last moments. 

My view is that mercy-killing shouldn't be allowed, because it makes more problems than it solves. I think a better solution to the problem of suffering at the end of life is to find better ways of preventing suffering. Hypnosis and morphine and whatever might be good, there might even be other solutions - but this is where I would rather see effort and emphasis placed. This reflects a general trend in my thinking - that good governance is providing the means to solve problems, not thinking that all problems can be solved by changes in the law. 

I agree with Houellebecq that the sum of dignity is not physical wellbeing. There is moral dignity as well. It is the better sense of dignity. He says:

'Well, so what? If that is dignity, one can very well do without it. On the other hand, everyone more or less needs to feel themselves necessary or loved; and, failing that, esteemedâ€”even in my case admired.'

I think this is all true. 

'The honour of a civilisation is not exactly nothing'. This is the summary of what I think life is missing. I don't see much honour in our civilisation - but I see the possibility of it, carried out of our solar system, and into the galaxy.
