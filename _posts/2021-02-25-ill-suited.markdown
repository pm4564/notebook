' Much of the best comedy involves people ill-suited to what they do – Captain Mainwaring is not officer class, Basil Fawlty lacks the manners for hospitality, David Brent can’t manage his own career. In Cheers and Frasier, Grammer’s character is a fish who feels both in and out of the waters he is in.'

Maybe I could write something like this. Maybe I am ill suited to what I do? 

Something like this about a scientist would be good.
