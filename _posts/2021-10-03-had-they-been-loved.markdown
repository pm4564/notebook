'In everyone there sleeps   
A sense of life lived according to love.
To some it means the difference they could make   
By loving others, but across most it sweeps
As all they might have done had they been loved.'

I think this is the best summary of the problems of a friend of mine. Though I wouldn't claim to find meaning only in the difference I make by loving others - I feel like I need love to. And maybe he would say to me - you've been given all the love you could possibly need - of course it's not your problem. I don't know.
