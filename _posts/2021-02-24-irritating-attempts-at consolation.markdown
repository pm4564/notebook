‘ I think,’ he said, after one of those useless and indeed rather irritating attempts at consolation — consolation, after all, does imply a superiority of experience or just plain intellect on the part of the consoler: a superiority which an intensely discontented mind is unlikely to accept — ‘I think I shall ride over to Shelmerston this afternoon.’

From ‘Blue at the Mizzen’, by Patrick O’Brian

This passage contains a lot of what I love about the Aubrey-Maturin books. They have a lot of the sort of wisdom that seems trite and fake-clever at first. But later, when you come back to it, it sings truth, 'pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul'.

Avoiding irritating attempts at consolation really is a skill, and one that I'd like to work on. I can't bear it when people console me or show concern. I guess it's a pride thing - in your head acknowledging pity or concern is accepting weakness or failure, and you might not be ready to accept that just yet. 

Reading back over this I really don't want to publish it - it strikes me as cliched and boring, but I the whole point of this is just to keep putting things out there, and letting them get better over time. You can't have interesting thoughts, well-expressed, every day. Get over it.
