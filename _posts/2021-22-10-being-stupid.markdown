This is the best articulation of what has gone wrong with my life. An unwillingness to look stupid has meant that I've always skipped any of the hard work of understanding anything. This means that there are actually some really basic things that I just don't get at all - I've gone from not wanting to look stupid to actually being stupid. Now what has to happen is to spend that time on those basic things and see where it gets you - and to implement this stuff in the rest of your life.
