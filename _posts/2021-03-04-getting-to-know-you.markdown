My mother likes to belt out songs from musicals, particularly Richard Rodgers songs - I'm gonna wash that man, When I take you out in the surrey, GETTING TO KNOW YOU. And seven brides for seven brothers, and West side story - more than almost anyone I know she really has music in her soul - and she is wonderfully lyrical and word playey - she likes nonsense rhymes, she likes to give a name to any adjective - colin cross, for example, which was usually shortened to colin. Her words and way of speaking are so distinctive - and she has this vast store of knowledge about so many things. And her energy - she cannot sit still.
