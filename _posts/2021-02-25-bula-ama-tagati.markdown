'Kill the wizards!'

Why did Dingaan, in 'black and feathered splendour', decide to kill the Boer leaders in the end? They beat in their heads and shoved wooden spears up their anuses and out of their chests. 

Why entertain their notions of a state in Natal at all? Why lead them on, unless it was just to retrieve his 700 cattle from the Sikonyela.
